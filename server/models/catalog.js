 * The main difference between the schema and model is that the model
 * connects to the DB and the schema doesn't. We should only use the model
 * when we are needing to interact with that collection of data. If
 * we are just enforcing the rules of the model in another model, 
 * we should create a separate schema to mirror the rules.
